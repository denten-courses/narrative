## Course Description

This graduate course offers an in-depth exploration of narrative theory, examining how stories
are constructed, interpreted, and function across different genres, media, and cultural
contexts. Students will engage with both classical and contemporary theories of narrative,
borrowing from research in literary studies, psychology, anthropology, sociology, film and game
studies.

The course will cover essential concepts such as plot, character, temporality,
, and point of view, while also addressing the role of narrative in shaping
personal and collective identities. Through close readings, theoretical analysis, and practical
application, students will critically analyze the power of narrative to reflect, challenge,
and transform cultural, social, and political realities. This course is ideal for students
interested in literary studies, media studies, and other fields where storytelling plays a
central role.


## Course Requirements & Grading

Students will be expected to read the approximate equivalent of three scholarly articles per
week, to attend seminars weekly, to participate in the class discussion both in person and
online, and to develop a research project that will culminate in a paper. Advanced students
will have the option to integrate the course's themes with the subject matter of their
expertise.

Grade breakdown:

- Class Participation 25%
- Weekly response online forum 25%
- Midterm project proposal 20%
- Final project 30%

## University Policies

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your instructors, and to
the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the
risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or
ask me for help early in the writing process. We will discuss the use appropriate of AI aids,
such as ChatGPT and Copilot, in class.
