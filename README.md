## Course Description

This graduate course offers an in-depth exploration of contemporary narrative theory, examining
how stories function across different genres, media, and cultural contexts. Students should
expect significant engagement with scholarship on narrative, borrowing from research in
literary studies, psychology, anthropology, sociology, philosophy, film and game studies.
Topics covered include story, plot, schema, time, space, character, agency, setting, frame,
event, and action while also addressing the role of narrative in shaping personal and
collective identities.

## Course Requirements & Grading

Students will be expected to read the approximate equivalent of three scholarly articles per
week, to attend seminars weekly, to participate in the class discussion both in person and
online, and to develop a research project that will culminate in a paper. Advanced students
will have the option to integrate the course's themes with the subject matter of their
expertise.

Grade breakdown:

- Class Participation 25%
- Weekly response online forum 25%
- Midterm project proposal 20%
- Final project 30%

## University Policies

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your instructors, and to
the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the
risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or
ask me for help early in the writing process. We will discuss the use appropriate of AI aids,
such as ChatGPT and Copilot, in class.
